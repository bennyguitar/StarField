StarField

## What is this??? ##

A UIView subclass with moving stars. Looks sweet and super easy to implement.

## Installation ##

Drag the included <code>StarField.m, StarField.h</code> files into your project. Import StarField.h into your ViewController. Drag a UIView out in InterfaceBuilder, and set its class to StarField in the Identity Inspector. You're now ready to blast off.

## Using StarField ##

Use the <code>-(void)addStars:(int)num</code> function to prepopulate your StarField. I've found that 180 to 220 looks good on iPhone.

Start the StarField moving with the <code>startStarField</code> method. Stop it with the similarly named <code>stopStarField</code>
